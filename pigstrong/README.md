This project is the code for Paper
 "2P-DNN : Privacy-Preserving Deep Neural Networks Based on Homomorphic Cryptosystem".

We offer you some functions for 2P-DNN model in ToolDNN. You can use these function to
build your own 2P-DNN model.

We also give a demo in MNIST_Demo. You can use this demo on crypto-MNIST.

More deteil you can refer to the paper.

PS: We have found problem in some aspect of our 2P-DNN model, such as Security Proof,
BN layer. If you have some questions, please contact qzhu@stu.xidian.edu.cn
